#       A crontab file contains entries for each cron job. Entries are separated by newline characters. Each crontab file entry contains six
#       fields separated by spaces or tabs in the following form:
#
#       second minute  hour  day_of_month  month  weekday  command
#
#       These fields accept the following values:
#
#       second
#            0 through 59
#       minute
#            0 through 59
#       hour
#            0 through 23
#       day_of_month
#            1 through 31
#       month
#            1 through 12
#       weekday
#            0 through 6 for Sunday through Saturday
#       command
#            a shell command
#
#       You must specify a value for each field. Except for the command field, these fields can contain the following:
#       *    A number in the specified range. To run a command in May, specify 5 in the month field.
#       *    Two numbers separated by a dash to indicate an inclusive range. To run a cron job on Tuesday through Friday, place 2-5 in the
#            weekday field.
#       *    A list of numbers separated by commas. To run a command on the first and last day of January, you would specify 1,31 in the
#            day_of_month field.
#       *    A combination of two numbers separated by a dash to indicate an inclusive range and a list of numbers separated by commas can be
#            used in conjunction. To run a command on the first, tenth to sixteenth and last day of January, you would specify 1,10-16,31 in
#            the day_of_month field. The above two points can also be used in combination.
#       *    An * (asterisk), meaning all allowed values. To run a job every hour, specify an asterisk in the hour field.
#
#            Note: Any character preceded by a backslash (including the %) causes that character to be treated literally. The specification
#            of days may be made by two fields (day of the month and day of the week). If you specify both as a list of elements, both are
#            adhered to. For example, the following entry:
#
#            0 0 1,15 * 1 command
#
#       would run command on the first and fifteenth days of each month, as well as every Monday. To specify days by only one field, the
#       other field should contain an * .
